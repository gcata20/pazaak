### **Pazaak**
- work in progress...

Pazaak is a card game in the Star Wars universe, similar to Blackjack. Players aim to reach a score of 20, or as close as possible, without going over. Before a match, you will construct a 10-card side deck from which 4 cards will be randomly assigned to your hand. You may choose to play these cards to manipulate your score, thus introducing elements of chance and strategy to the game.
